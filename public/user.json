    "description": "Awesome camera, one of the best mirrorless camera within budget, 18-150 lense is also superb, picture quality is good and as it is all touch screen it is easy to adjust the controls in manual Mode and it will help the newbie photographers who is switching from mobile to DSLR. One can blindly buy this and learn photography.",
